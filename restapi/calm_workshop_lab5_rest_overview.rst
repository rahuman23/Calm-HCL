REST/HTTP Overview
******************


The REST (Web Services) APIs (i.e. WS-API) allow users to author scripts or integrate with 3^rd^ platform solutions, designed to automate the execution of system administration commands against a Nutanix endpoint or resource. The API is designed to expose backend data of a Nutanix cluster that can be read or written to using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
**********************************

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems, and is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes (i.e. Web Services, or RESTful API’s), including extensions of built-in request methods, error codes, and headers.

HTTP is based on the client-server architecture model and a stateless request/response protocol that operates by exchanging messages across a reliable TCP/IP connection.

An HTTP "client" is a program (Web browser, thick-client, script, etc.) that establishes a connection to a server for the purpose of sending one or more HTTP request messages. An HTTP "server" is a program (i.e. Apache web-server running on the CVM) that accepts connections in order to serve HTTP requests by sending HTTP response messages.

Client: sends a request-line to the server in the form of a request-method, URI, and protocol-version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client information, and possibly entity-body content (i.e. JSON) over a TCP/IP connection.

Server: responds with a status-line, including the message's protocol-version and a status-code (success or error code), followed by a MIME-like message containing server information, entity meta information, and possibly entity-body content (i.e. JSON).

HTTP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
**************************************

HTTP makes use of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to identify a given resource and establish a connection. Once the connection is established, HTTP messages are passed between client and server. These messages include requests from client to server and responses from server to client: HTTP-message = <Request> | <Response> ; [^1]HTTP/1.1 messages

Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) are formatted, case-insensitive strings containing name, location, etc., to identify a resource, for example, a website, or a web service (i.e. abs_path = /PrismGateway/Services/rest/v2.0/vms/). A general syntax of URI used for HTTP is as follows:

[^2]URI = “http:” “//” host [“:” port] [abs_path [“?” query]]

HTTP Request/Response Message
*****************************

HTTP request(s) and response(s) use a generic message format for transferring required data. This generic message format consists of the following:

start-line [request-line | status-line]:

The request-line is initiated by the client and begins with a request-method specifying the action to be taken, followed by a request-URI identifying the resource the action is to be performed on, and ending with the protocol-version to determine the handshaking. The following are list of common [^3]request-methods found in most REST API implementations.

GET: Retrieves information from a specified server for a given URI (resource).

POST: Sends data to a specified server to create a resource for a given URI (resource).

PUT: Update data for a specified resource for a given URI (resource).

DELETE: Remove a resource instance for a given URI (resource).

e.g. request-line: GET /vms/ HTTP/1.1

A status-line is initiated by the server and consists of the protocol-version followed by a numeric status-code and associated textual phrase. The status-code element is a 3-digit integer where the first digit defines the class of response, and last 2 digits define detail.

1XX: [Informational] Request was received and in-process.

2XX: [Success] Request successfully received understood, and accepted.

3XX: [Redirection] further action is required to complete request

4XX: [Client Error] request contains incorrect syntax or can’t be fulfilled.

5XX: [Server Error] server failed to fulfill the request.

e.g. status-line: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

header [field-name “:” [field-value]]:

The header provides information that qualifies the request or response messages, to include the message-body (assuming it exists). Header field-names and field-values vary depending on if the message is a request or response, and if there’s a message-body attached:

message-body (optional):

The message carries the entity-body associated with the request or response. If entity-body is present, **content-type **and content-length header lines specify the nature of the body (in the context of a REST API’s content-type: application/json, content-length: size of JSON in bytes).


JSON Message-Body
*****************

Both the request and response message payloads in REST API implementations use a lightweight, self-describing data-interchange referred to as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) used to structure data (as text) composed of objects containing <key,value> pairs, or arrays of objects. Since JSON format is text, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and consumed by any programming language.

JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript Object Notation syntax where:

Data is organized using key,value pairs, and separated by commas (“,”).

Curly braces (“{“, “}”) hold objects containing key,value pairs.

Square brackets ([ ]) hold arrays of objects.

A key/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value: e.g. "model":"nx3160". In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:

String (values are in double quote “ ” notation)

Number (must be integer or floating point)

Object (surrounded by curly bracket { } notation. Can have embedded objects.)

Array (square bracket [ ] notation, indexed by integers starting at 0)

Boolean (literal: true or false)

Null (written as null)

The following JSON example defines a Nutanix “disks” array, containing 3 “disk” objects:

{“disks":[
    {“disk”:{ "vendor":"seagate", "type":"hdd", "capacity":8000000000000,“encrypted”: false}, “device_bus”=”scsi”},
    {“disk”:{ "vendor":"seagate", "type":"hdd", "capacity":8000000000000,“encrypted”: false}, “device_bus”=”scsi”},
    {“disk”:{ "vendor":"toshiba", "type":"ssd",  "capacity":1200000000000,“encrypted”: false}, “device_bus”=”scsi”}
]}
