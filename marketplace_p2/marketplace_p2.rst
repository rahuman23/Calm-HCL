Calm Marketplace Part 2
**************************


Overview
************

.. note::

  This exercise assumes you have a Blueprint available from a previous exercise.

  Estimated time to completion: **40 MINUTES**

In this exercise you will learn how to manage Calm Blueprints within the Nutanix Marketplace. As part of the exercise you will publish a Blueprint from the Blueprint Editor, use Marketplace Manager to approve, assign roles and projects, and publish to the Marketplace. Finally you will edit a project environment so your Blueprint can be launched directly from the Marketplace.

Approving Blueprints
********************

Review the available actions:

From **Prism Central > Apps**, select |image13| **Projects** from the sidebar.

Select the Project **Name** associated with your Blueprint at the time of publishing (e.g. the **Calm** Project that was assigned as **Project Shared With**).
