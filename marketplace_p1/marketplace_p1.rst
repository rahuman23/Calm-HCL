Publishing Blueprints from Marketplace Manager
**********************************************

By default, Calm comes pre-seeded with validated Blueprints for multiple open source and enterprise applications. Marketplace Manager acts as a staging area for publishing default and user-created Blueprints to your local Marketplace. The Marketplace acts as an application store, providing end users with a catalog of available applications.

From **Prism Central > Apps**, select |image1| **Marketplace Manager** from the sidebar.

Under **Marketplace Blueprints**, select **Mongo**.

Note the Blueprint description contains key information including licensing, hardware requirements, OS, supported platforms, and limitations. Click **Publish**.

Takeaways
***********
- By using pre-seeded Blueprints from the Nutanix Marketplace, users can quickly try out new applications.
- Marketplace Blueprints can be cloned and modified to suit a user's needs. For example, the pre-seeded LAMP Blueprint could be a starting point for a developer looking to swap PHP for a Go application server.
- Marketplace Blueprints can use local disk images or automatically download associated disk images. Users can create their own keys and slipstream them into Blueprints (via cloud-init) to control access.
